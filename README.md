# Template Engine - Employee Summary

One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. This project allows you to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage. The data generated then displays summaries for each person.

## Technology Used

We used the Node, JQuery, HTML, CSS to build, style, and add effects to our application. We are also using JEST make sure the code is maintainable and passes all tests.

# Summary

As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

# Getting started

- First, start by running npm install. This will make sure you have access to all of the packages.
-Then run "npm app.js" to begin being prompted with questions regarding your team.
-Once you have entered everyone's information, enter "false for the last prompt" and you will see the autogenerated html page under the output folder!
